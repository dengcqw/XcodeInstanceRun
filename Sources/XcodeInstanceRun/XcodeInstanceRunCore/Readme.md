my thoughts
1.  I want to compile only current edited file, to see any compile error quickly
2.  I wan to compile modified files and link to app execute file quickly

two manner
1. reuse xcode default derived folder, but easy changed by xcode build, if xcode building swift is not single file model.
2. create indenpendant derived folder, if not use ios-depoly, use xcode to install app, you need copy app execute and dysym to xcode default derived folder.

basic usage
